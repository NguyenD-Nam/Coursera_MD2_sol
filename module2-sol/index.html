			<div class="title">Banh Mi</div>
			<p>In the north of Vietnam, chefs stick to the basic elements of carbohydrate, fat and protein -- bread, margarine and pata -- but head south and your banh mi may contain a more colorful combination of cheese, cold cuts, pickled vegetables, sausage, fried egg, fresh cilantro and chili sauce.</p>

			<div class="title">Bun Bo Hue</div>
			<p>Central Vietnam's take on noodles caters to carnivores with its meaty broth and piles of beef and pork. The thick slippery rice noodles also make for a heartier meal than noodles found in the north and south.</p>

		<div class="item" id="pho">
			<div class="title">Pho</div>
			<p>It's almost impossible to walk a block in Vietnam's major destinations without bumping into a crowd of hungry patrons slurping noodles at a makeshift pho stand. This simple staple consisting of a salty broth, fresh rice noodles, a sprinkling of herbs and chicken or beef, features predominately in the local diet -- and understandably so. It's cheap, tasty, and widely available at all hours.</p>
